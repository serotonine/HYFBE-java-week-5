/**
 * Exercise 3: Period and Duration Calculations
 * 
 * Scenario: You need to calculate time differences for various situations
 * 
 * TODO: Complete the following tasks
 * 
 * 1. Calculate your exact age in years, months, and days using Period
 * 2. Create a method that calculates the number of days between two dates
 * 3. Calculate the working hours in a day (9:00 AM to 5:30 PM) using Duration
 * 4. Add a 30-minute lunch break to calculate actual working time
 * 5. Calculate how many days are left until New Year's Day (January 1, 2027)
 * 6. Create a Period of 1 year, 6 months, and 15 days, then add it to today
 * 7. BONUS: Calculate how many full weeks are between your birthday and today
